## Architecture and Design Decisions

### Overview

This project implements a posts listing application with a focus on clean architecture, type safety, and testability. Here's a breakdown of the key architectural decisions and flow:

### Application Flow

1. **Data Flow**

   - The application fetches posts data from an external API
   - Data is validated and typed using TypeScript and Zod for complete type safety
   - Server-side rendering is utilized for better performance and SEO

2. **Component Structure**

   - Pages are built using Next.js App Router
   - Components are organized by feature/domain
   - Shared components are placed in a common directory for reusability

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for page-level functionality
   - Mocked data for consistent test scenarios
   - React Testing Library for behavior-driven tests
   - Playwright for end-to-end testing across multiple browsers
   - End-to-end test coverage for critical user flows

### How it Works

1. **Initial Page Load**

   - When a user visits the posts page, Next.js triggers server-side rendering
   - Server component fetches the initial posts data
   - The page is rendered with the fetched data and sent to the client
   - On the client side that initial data is feed into redux for easier state management

2. **On post specific page**

   - Post data is either fetched from the data encoded in the url or fetched server side via the id
   - The post card is populated with the data
   - if no data can't be provided via the url or the call to the external api a friendly message is shown

3. **Data Fetching**

   - Posts are fetched from the external API using typed fetch requests
   - Response data is validated against TypeScript types
   - Error boundaries handle potential API failures
   - Loading states are managed during data fetching

4. **Pagination Flow**

   - Initially 20 posts are show per default, but url parameters can be provided to customize how the fetching works
   - New data is fetched based on updated parameters
   - Page re-renders with new data while maintaining scroll position
   - When scrolling to the bottom of the page more posts are automatically fetched
   - if now more posts are available according to the total returned from the api, no more requests are made
     - Redux toolkit query (RTK) provides a infinity query functionality that is used here
     - [useGetInfinitePostsInfiniteQuery](lib/features/posts/postsApiSlice.ts) in used inside the hook `[useLoadInfinitePosts](lib/hooks/useLoadInfinitePosts.ts), which uses intersection observer to trigger the function to fetch another page and thus perform pagination correctly
     - the returned data from the pages is flatten, so the consumer gets a list of posts that keeps incrementing while we fetch more items on scroll

5. **Error Handling**
   - API errors are caught and displayed user-friendly messages
   - Type validation ensures data consistency
   - Loading states prevent UI issues during data fetches
   - Fallback UI for edge cases
